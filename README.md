This tool generates embedded C code from UPPAAL modes.
The tool supports various hardware architectures.

UPPAAL (http://www.uppaal.org/) is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems 
modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays, etc.).
